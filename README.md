# TimeCalculator
Function that takes a starting time and duration and adds the duration onto the start time, whilst also providing additional information about the operation. For example, if the given duration would cause the end time to be during the next day, the program will tell you this. If it is a 1.5 weeks later, it will tell you so.
Furthermore, if the day of the week is provided to the function, it will also return the day the time ends on.
